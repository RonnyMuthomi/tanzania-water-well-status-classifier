## 📌 Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the condition of water wells in Tanzania, classifying them as:

- **Functional**
- **Functional but needs repair**
- **Non functional**

Clean water access is a significant challenge in Tanzania. By analyzing well attributes such as pump type, water source, construction year, and management methods, this project supports better maintenance planning and resource allocation. The goal is to assist NGOs and the Tanzanian government in proactively identifying failing infrastructure and improving future water point installations.

## 📊 Business and Data Understanding

### 🔍 Business Context

Tanzania has over 59 million people, many of whom rely on public water points for access to clean water. However, thousands of these water points are either broken or in poor condition. Field inspections are expensive and time-consuming. A predictive model can help prioritize which wells need attention.

### 🎯 Stakeholders

- **Government of Tanzania** – for infrastructure planning and monitoring
- **NGOs and Aid Agencies** – to target interventions efficiently
- **Local Communities** – who depend on well functionality
- **Field Technicians** – to focus inspections and repairs
- **Donors & Development Partners** – to ensure impact of funds

### 📁 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Taarifa and DrivenData, covering over 59,000 water access points. It contains features like:

- Pump/extraction type
- Water source and quality
- Construction year
- Geographical information
- Management and funding entities

The target variable is `status_group`, a three-class label indicating the well’s condition.
