    "**Predicting Water Well Functionality in Tanzania Using Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project applies machine learning to predict the functional status of water wells across Tanzania using features such as pump type, water source, construction year, and location. By classifying wells as functional, functional but needs repair, or non functional, the model helps NGOs and government agencies prioritize repairs and optimize future infrastructure planning. The goal is to support sustainable clean water access in underserved communities."

    "### üìò **Overview / Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tanzania, a developing East African nation with a population exceeding 57 million, faces ongoing challenges in providing clean and safe drinking water. Over the years, thousands of water access points (wells, pumps, and springs) have been constructed throughout the country, particularly in rural and underserved areas. However, many of these water points fall into disrepair or become completely non-functional due to poor maintenance, unsuitable construction methods, or environmental factors. Identifying which wells are failing and understanding why is a critical step toward sustainable water access.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üöß **Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many wells are currently non-functional or in need of repair, but there is no efficient way to identify and prioritize them.\n",
    "- Maintenance and inspection resources are limited, particularly in rural areas.\n",
    "- Existing datasets are often large, complex, and contain inconsistencies or missing values.\n",
    "- Decisions about water point design and deployment are not always data-driven, leading to repeat failures.\n",
    "- NGOs and governments struggle to monitor and maintain infrastructure efficiently without predictive insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° **Proposed Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using historical water well data, we aim to build a supervised machine learning model that classifies the current condition of each water point into one of three categories: functional, functional but needs repair, or non-functional. By analyzing features such as water source, extraction type, location, installation ye ar, and management method, the model can uncover patterns associated with failures. The resulting tool can help organizations proactively maintain wells and optimize future water point planning by predicting which types and conditions tend to succeed or fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîö **Brief Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses machine learning to address a real-world infrastructure problem affecting millions in Tanzania. A well-performing model could save significant resources, improve clean water access, and support evidence-based decisions for future water infrastructure investments. This predictive approach transforms raw water well data into actionable insights for governments and NGOs alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùì **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tanzania, many existing water wells are either non-functional or in poor condition, yet organizations lack an effective method to identify which wells need repair or are at risk of failure. With limited resources and thousands of water points to monitor, there is an urgent need for a data-driven approach to support decision-making and optimize maintenance efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ **Key Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop a classifier that accurately predicts the condition of a water well.\n",
    "- Enable proactive identification of at-risk or failing wells.\n",
    "- Support efficient allocation of maintenance resources.\n",
    "- Provide insight into construction and management patterns that lead to long-term functionality.\n",
